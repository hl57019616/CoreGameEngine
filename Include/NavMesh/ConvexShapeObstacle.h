/**
  * Convex obstacles are a more complex type of temporary obstacles that can be used together with
  * the Detour Tile Cache.
  * In contrast to simple cylindrical obstacles they allow any type of geometry to be defined as an obstacle.
  * A convex obstacle relies on a simple convex hull of the obstacle it represents. It uses a simplified 2D
  * approximation of the convex hull with a height (the hull is on the x-z ground plane, and has one height
  * that is the same for each point, kind of like an upright cylinder where the sides don't have to be simply
  * round but can be any shape).
  * Convex obstacles can both be moved and given a different orientation (rotation). When rotating the convex
  * hull approximation has to be rebuilt, as it is only a simple 2D approximation instead of a full 3D hull.
  * Also note that the convex hull algorithm that is currently used is very fast but also very limited. Don't
  * feed it too much geometry.
  * Alternatively, when not rotating obstacles it's also possible to use the bounding box of the object instead
  * of calculating a hull (in case the bounding box approximates the obstacle well, for example in case of a
  * box or rectangular shape).
